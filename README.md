# ryomodular.com_accurate_voltmeter
 an led vu type meter but accurate for eurorack levl voltages.

the  origins of this lie in the wonderous 'archive of mysteries' i inherited when i took over sole control of the company without having a clue what i was sitting on for the best part of a decade.

this one seemed quite simple so a good candidate for either quick 5release or consumption by a bigger more advanced and greter capabilty module.

as it stands it's plainand simple a voltmeter based on led towers arranged such that they can display accurate 20 point setp for -10Vpp signals or switched to -5V to =5v or -10V to +10V but oviously as need arises this will likely ebolve somewhat. it currenly does nothing more than display voltage applied at input and buffer it through to the output to send it on its wa as if never seen by an 'accurate voltmeter'. i currrently see most likely sue for this as the display for the undeveloped jacobs ladder project, showing which stage of the violtage splitter is outputting or selected or active or w/e.
as far as whther t will ever be a module in its own right? unlikelyaam afraid but it'll for sur be a prominent part of something involving a very crucial display of a whole scale of varioius voltages passing through.

i'll  leave  it here for  ow as a result but keep 'em peeled to watch releases or github uploads to find out what happens...
